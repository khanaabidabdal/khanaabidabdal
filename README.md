  ## Projects

  - **Ai Image Classifier : Fake Vs Real Faces** : Developed a robust computer vision model aimed at distinguishing between real and AI-generated faces. Leveraged the ResNet50 architecture for both feature extraction and fine-tuning to enhance classification accuracy. The project involved:

     Implementing the model in Google Colab with a free GPU for training and testing.
    
     Designing an interactive user interface using Gradio for image upload and classification.
    
     Achieving a peak accuracy of 98% through fine-tuning with real-world data augmentation.
    
     Addressing overfitting and stability issues by experimenting with different training epochs.
    
     Deploying the application on Hugging Face for real-time classification.
    
     Submitting the research findings to Discover Artificial Intelligence, Springer Nature.
    
     Key Technologies: Python, PyTorch, ResNet50, Google Colab, Gradio, Hugging Face
